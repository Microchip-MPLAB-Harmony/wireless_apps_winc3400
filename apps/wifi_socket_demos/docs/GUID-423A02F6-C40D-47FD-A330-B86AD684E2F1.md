# Proximity Reporter Application Demo

This application demonstrates the proximity monitoring between the WINC3400 and Android Mobile phone with Microchip Bluetooth Data application.

**Note:**

Currently, this demo is disabled in the project **sam\_d21\_xpro\_winc3400.X** due to memory limitation.The user can enable this demo by enabling the macro **APP\_BLE\_PROXIMITY** in **app.h** file.

1.  This is an BLE application example. So the user need to download the Microchip Bluetooth Data application from App Store.

2.  Enter the command "appdemo start 15" to select and run the application.

7.  After configuration of the desired alert levels, click Immediate Alert service and then move the mobile phone away from the Proximity Reporter. Based on the distance of separation, Path Loss is plotted on the zone radar \(using RSSI values received from the Proximity Reporter\).

8.  Based on the zone, the Proximity Monitor sends the corresponding alert level. The console log on the Proximity Reporter displays the corresponding alerts.

9.  After configuration of the desired alert levels, click on the Link Loss service and then move the mobile phone away from the reporter. Keep moving until the “Link Loss”pop-up appears. The console log on the Proximity Reporter displays the corresponding alerts and when Link Loss occurs, it reports the disconnection.

10. After Link Loss, the mobile application attempts to reconnect to the Proximity Reporter. The connection is re-established by moving the mobile phone closer to the reporter.

11. Click the Tx Power Service icon in the services screen. The Proximity Monitor reads the Tx Power value from the Proximity Reporter and displays the TX POWER LEVEL.
