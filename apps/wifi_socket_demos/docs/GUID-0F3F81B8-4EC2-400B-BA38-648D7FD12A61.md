### Steps to isolate/copy individual application\(s\) from the demo

If the user wants to isolate an application, follow the below mentioned steps

For example, the user wants to create an SNTP demo in Socket mode.

1.  The SNTP demo uses the WiFi functionalities to get connected with the network. So copy the files "*app\_wifi.c*" and "*app\_wifi.h*" from the path "*wireless\_apps\_winc3400/apps/wifi\_bypass\_demos/firmware/src*" or "*wireless\_apps\_winc3400/apps/wifi\_socket\_demos/firmware/src*" to "src" folder of the new demo project. Then add these files to the project.

2.  Now user should copy and add the SNTP application files "*app\_sntp.c*" and "*app\_sntp.h*" from the path "*wireless\_apps\_winc3400/apps/wifi\_bypass\_demos/firmware/src*" or "*wireless\_apps\_winc3400/apps/wifi\_socket\_demos/firmware/src*" to the "*src* folder of the new demo project.

3.  The "*app.c*" and "*app.h*" files need to be copied by the user. These files integrate the SNTP application and WiFi functionalities. Copy and add these two files from the same "src" path to the "src" folder of the new demo project.

4.  In "app.c", within "*APP\_Initialize\(\)*" function, initialize the sntp application by calling "*APP\_SntpInitialize\(APPWiFiCallback\)*".

5.  In "app.c" file, make sure that, "*APP\_WiFiTasks\(wdrvHandle\)*" is getting called from the "*APP\_STATE\_WDRV\_OPEN*" state of "*APP\_Tasks\(\)*" state machine.

6.  In the same state machine "*APP\_Tasks\(\)*", within the state "*APP\_STATE\_WDRV\_APP\_LOOP*" , call the sntp application state machine "*APP\_SntpTasks\(handle\)*".

7.  Now follow the steps mentioned in the SNTP demo document to run the SNTP demo using "wifi", "sntp" and "appdemo" commands.


Similarly, for any application demo, take the required application files along with WiFi files and "app" files to create the demo.

### Steps to isolate/copy individual BLE application\(s\) from the demo

For BLE applications, no need to copy the WiFi files. But the user should copy the Ble\_Service and Ble\_Profile files from the path "*wireless\_apps\_winc3400\\apps\\wifi\_socket\_demos\\firmware\\src\\ble*".

For example, the user wants to create a new project, say "Heart\_rate\_demo", then

1.  Copy and add the ble\_manager files from the path "*wireless\_apps\_winc3400\\apps\\wifi\_socket\_demos\\firmware\\src\\ble\\ble\_services\\ble\_mgr*" to the "*Heart\_rate\_demo\\firmware\\src\\ble\\ble\_services\\ble\_mgr*" of the new project.

2.  Copy and add the Heart rate profile files from the path "*wireless\_apps\_winc3400\\apps\\wifi\_socket\_demos\\firmware\\src\\ble\\ble\_profiles\\hr\_sensor*" to the "*Heart\_rate\_demo\\firmware\\src\\ble\\ble\_profiles\\hr\_sensor*" of the new project.

3.  Copy and add the Heart rate service files from the path "*wireless\_apps\_winc3400\\apps\\wifi\_socket\_demos\\firmware\\src\\ble\\ble\_services\\heart\_rate*" to the "*Heart\_rate\_demo\\firmware\\src\\ble\\ble\_services\\heart\_rate*" of the new project.

4.  Now copy and add the application files "app\_heart\_rate.c" and "app\_heart\_rate.h" from "*wireless\_apps\_winc3400\\apps\\wifi\_socket\_demos\\firmware\\src*" to the "*Heart\_rate\_demo\\firmware\\src*" of the new project.

5.  Copy and add the main application files "app.c" and "app.h" files from "*wireless\_apps\_winc3400\\apps\\wifi\_socket\_demos\\firmware\\src*" to the "*Heart\_rate\_demo\\firmware\\src*" of the new project.

6.  In "app.c", within "*APP\_Initialize\(\)*" function, initialize the Heart Rate application by calling "*APP\_BleHeartrateInitialize\(APPWiFiCallback\)*".

7.  In "app.c" file, make sure that, "*APP\_BleHeartrateTasks\(wdrvHandle\)*" is getting called from the "*APP\_STATE\_WDRV\_OPEN*" state of "*APP\_Tasks\(\)*" state machine.

8.  Add the macro "BLE\_DEVICE\_ROLE=BLE\_PERIPHERAL" in the project properties.

    ![project_properties](GUID-C989929B-2974-4594-B484-F17D0E9F1688-low.png)

9.  Now follow the steps mentioned in the "Heart rate demo document" to run the application using "appdemo" command.


Similarly, for any ble application demo, take the required application files, ble\_profile files, ble\_service files and "app" files to create the demo.

**Note:**

1.  User has to make sure the project path does not exceed windows path limit.

2.  User should reset the device before switching the application and unpair the device from the android phone in case of switching BLE application demos.
