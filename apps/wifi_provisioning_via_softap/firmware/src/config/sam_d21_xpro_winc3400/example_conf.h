  File Name:
    example_conf.h

  Summary:
    This header file provides configuration for the example.

  Description:
    This header file provides function prototypes and data type definitions for
    the application.  Some of these are required by the system (such as the
    "APP_Initialize" and "APP_Tasks" prototypes) and some of them are only used
    internally by the application (such as the "APP_STATES" definition).  Both
    are defined here for convenience.
