# Supported Network Modes in WINC

WINC devices can work in two modes.

* Socket mode
* Bypass mode.

## Socket Mode

By default, WINC firmware includes TCP/ IP Stack, and Wifi/ BT MAC.
Socket Mode exports driver level APIs for the User to write his Application and configure / communicate the TCP/ IP Stack and the Wi-Fi Stack using these APIs.

## Bypass Mode

In Bypass mode, instead of using TCP/IP stack of WINC firmware, user can use Harmony 3 TCP/IP stack on host side and directly access mac layer of WINC firmware via the WINC Driver APIs. In this case TCP/IP stack of WINC firmware is bypassed.
